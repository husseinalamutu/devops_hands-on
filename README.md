# devops_hands-on
A repository that contains practical hands-on exercises related to Cloud and DevOps. I will be sharing different practical tasks here and also include their solutions along with a link to the article that serves as the step by step guide to the solution.

In the nearest future, I might consider open-sourcing it for others to contribute also.
